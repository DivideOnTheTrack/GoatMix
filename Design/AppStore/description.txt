Finish your mix on the go with GoatAudio's GoatMix! GoatMix is a fully featured semi-modular mixing suite featuring all the essential tools necessary to polish your mixes on the go in any AUv3 supporting DAW.

GoatMix's submodules include:
- Gain: amplitude and phase adjustment with visualizations.
- Compressor: hard-knee compression with adjustable dry/wet mixing for parallel compression.
- Reverb: variable-size room reverb.
- Distortion: bit-crusher distortion with soft clipping overdrive.
- EQ: four configurable bands of equalization as high pass, low pass, high shelf, low shelf, and peak filters.

The effect chain order is configurable by bypassing/muting each effect tab, or rearranging them for a different order!
